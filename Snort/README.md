# Traffic Generator

The machine is offline, but there is a script (traffic-generator.sh) for you to generate traffic to your snort interface. You will use this script to trigger traffic to the snort interface. Once you run the script, it will ask you to choose the exercise type and then automatically open another terminal to show you the output of the selected action.

Note that each traffic is designed for a specific exercise. Make sure you start the snort instance and wait until to end of the script execution. Don't stop the traffic flood unless you choose the wrong exercise. 

Run the "traffic generator.sh" file by executing it as sudo. 

   - sudo ./traffic-generator.sh

Once you choose an action, the menu disappears and opens a terminal instance to show you the output of the action.
